# About Me

I am a research software engineer specialising in graphics programming, GPU and HPC programming, python and jupyter notebooks. I have particular interest in the applications of 3D Graphics and literate programming to scientific and data visualisation and building customisable research environments and pipelines based on the jupyter/python ecosystem, also the application of these technologies for wider research and creative communities, including the arts (fine and humanities).

## Visualisation
A few bits and pieces that are viewable online or have associated articles/press/publications:
- [Mars Oceans Visualisation](https://bridges.monash.edu/articles/media/Mars_Oceans_Visualisation/12792575) playing around with open data, GLSL shader flooding the Martian planet surface with topography created from public domain data obtained from the USGS Astrogeology Science Center.
- [Cyclone Debbie wind tracers over Great Barrier Reef, data from eReefs](https://bridges.monash.edu/articles/media/Cyclone_Debbie_wind_tracers_over_Great_Barrier_Reef_data_from_eReefs/12725381) open data read from NCI thredds catalogue.
- Created this [brain connectivity 3d model](https://lavavu.github.io/webview.html?brain.gldb&background=white) to assist with Dr. Nicholas Mangan's ["Termite Economies"](https://www.monash.edu/mada/research/termite-economies)
